# Solution

1. Machine learning is the science of programming computers to be able to learn from a dataset and make predictions.
2. Four types of application where machine learning shines: complex solution with no algorithmic solution, to replace long lists of hand-tuned rules, to build systems that adapt to changing environments, and to help humans learn.
3. A labeled training set is a training set that contains the desired solution of each instance.
4. Two most common supervised tasks are classification and regression.
